        <li>My website is for my family who are huge dog lovers.</li>
        <li>I have many headers</li>
        <li>I have 5 separate pages</li>
        <li>I have links on my info page</li>
        <li>Some of my pages follow this requirment decently, some dont do a very good jonb. If I were to do this assignment over again I believe i would be able to do a very good job of this. But after writing a bunch of spegetti code when I first started this assignment, it was a bit of a mess to try to incorporate this.</li>
        <li>I am unsure if having CSS in your html document is bad coding practice, but when when one of my pages needed to have specific elements that different from my other pages, I put that code in the sytle element in the html document.</li>
        <li>I have images and alt attributes on all of them describing what the photo is. </li>
        <li>I have a favicon on all pages</li>
        <li>I did not do a good job of this. I tried organizing my images in folders but then obviously that messed up the path of the photo. At this point I had too mamy photos to go and change all of the paths before the deadline of this project.
        </li>
        <li>I did not use any frameworks.</li>
        <li>CSS validator and HTML validator say no errors found</li>
        <li>URL and gitHub have been shared to you via slack.</li>
        <li>URL and gitHub have been shared to you.</li>
        <li>Files are lowercase.</li>
        <li>My site is being served out of port 8443</li>
        <li>My site is only accessed through HTTPS</li>
        <li>I believe my content  is neatly aligned with everything</li>
        <li>I use multiple fonts in this project.</li>
        <li>I use a form element on my about page.</li>
        <li>I have many links on my info page that open a new tab once clicked on.</li>
        <li>Some names for classes and ids for this project could be much better. I found myself having a hard time following some of my code because the lack of a good name choice.</li>
        <li>I have an animation on my about page.</li>
      </ol> <br>

      <p>Client critique: I loved the about us page with the photos and a look behind the scenes of this "company". The site was easy to navigate and the color scheme was nice and appealing. Some of the pages get funky if you try to shrink the screen. It would have been nice for more info rather than just a bunch of links in the info page. Overal a nice simple webpage.  </p>
